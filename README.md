# clothing-store-html-css
Women Clothing E-commerce Website is a frontend practice project created using HTML and CSS. This project was developed by me to practice layout design, product sections, and styling for an online fashion store. It is built only for learning purposes and does not include real e-commerce functionality. Developed by Ahmed Arfan.
